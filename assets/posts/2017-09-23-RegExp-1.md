summary: Shortcuts to searching, broken down into English
---
The first time you see a regular expression it may merely look like a jumble of random characters, including what may look like a slash and backslash roller coaster `/\/`. Learning regular expressions (aka RegExp or Regex) can also feel like a roller coaster, so let's break it down to make it as easy as possible to master.

This isn't merely a regex cheat sheet; there are plenty of those on the internet already and it's not always the best way to learn something from scratch. This is a step-by-step breakdown of what the many parts of regex can do, and includes scripts that show what the regex does the hood and how it simplifies the process entirely. This way if you have absolutely no experience with regex you can learn it through examples and explanations, and even if you know regex it'll help solidify that knowledge.

What inspired this post was a [question on Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/regex-password-validation) about using regular expressions to validate a strong password. I'll go piece by piece to solve that in [part 2](https://mikemerin.github.io/RegExp-2/), but along with this post and the next one, in covering each piece we'll learn many different techniques!

If you're experienced with regex then you can simply go through the quiz at the end of the post to make sure you know the techniques used in this post before heading to [part 2](https://mikemerin.github.io/RegExp-2/).

# Languages
---
RegExp works virtually identically between many languages like Ruby, JavaScript, etc. While there's in-depth differences between how Python, PHP, Java, Perl, etc. handle certain regex functions, I won't be getting into that in this post.

With that out of the way let's quickly look at how Ruby and JavaScript can handle a simple query. For example: `/s/` means "find the letter `s`". I'll explain the query a bit more in depth later, but for now let's just quickly see how to invoke this in different languages:

```ruby
# Ruby
Regexp.new("s") #=> /s/

"strings".match(/s/) #=> <MatchData "s">
/s/.match("strings") #=> <MatchData "s">
"strings"[/s/] #=> "s"

"strings".scan(/s/) #=> ["s", "s"]

# getting the index
/s/ =~ "strings" #=> 0
/r/ =~ "strings" #=> 2
"strings" =~ /s/ #=> 0
"strings" =~ /r/ #=> 2

"string".split(/i/) #=> ["str, "ng"]
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
RegExp("s") //=> /s/

/s/.test("strings") //=> true

"strings".match(/s/) //=> ["s", index: 0, input: "strings"]
/s/.exec("strings") //=> ["s", index: 0, input: "strings"]

"strings".match(/s/g) //=> ["s", "s"]

"strings".match(/r/)[0] //=> "r"
"strings".match(/r/).index //=> 0

"string".split(/i/) //=> ["str, "ng"]
```

As you can see the syntax is nearly identical, and the actual RegExp syntax will be the mostly the same for both languages (again with the exception of more advanced in-depth techniques). With that said, I'll be using JS's "match" method throughout this post since as you can see above: it works the same way as Ruby's and gets almost the same amount of information, but JS natively outputs more information without having to invoke any additional methods.

Also a side-note, JavaScript has the worst regex engine out of all the major languages, which means if you can master it in JS, you'll be that much better when using it in other languages!

# Basic Searches
---
### Types of characters

There are a few types of characters you can search by. The normal alphanumeric characters can just be put in (a, b, c, 1, 2, 3, etc.).

However there are certain characters called "literal characters" that perform certain regex actions. Because of this, you must escape these characters to perform a search on them, just like if you're using "quotes" you have to escape to use a backslash in order to say it ("\" will give you an error since you're escaping the second " rather than saying a string of \. You'd have to do "\\" to do it).

These characters are: `[\^$.|?*+(){}`

In order to search for them you'll need to escape the same way: put a backslash `\` before it.

```javascript
"hello?".match(/hello?/)
// [ 'hello?', index: 0, input: 'hello?' ]
"^.^".match(/\^\.\^/)
// [ '^.^', index: 0, input: '^.^' ]
```

### Match anything inside

Let's cover what the above regex above did by looking up a specific character.

```javascript
"strings".match(/s/) //=> ["s", index: 0, input: "strings"]
```

`/s/` is our regular expression, denoted by the two slashes and what's inside of it. `/Anything surrounded by these slashes/` is what will be interpreted, in this case the letter "s". The regex `/s/` is saying: "go through this string and if you find the letter `s` return it, otherwise return `null`" (or some other falsey value in other languages, aka `nil` in Ruby). Here's the literal example in both Ruby and JavaScript:

```ruby
# Ruby
found = nil
"strings".split("").each { |x| found = x; break if x == "s" }
puts found
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
var found = null
"strings".split("").some(x => {
  if (x === "y")
    { found = x }
  return (x === "y")
})
console.log(found)
```

`.some` is basically `.forEach` (`.each` in Ruby) that breaks after an answer is found. When I reference these from now on I'll just simply say `if ___ console.log(result)` as shorthand.

As you can see, the regex script `"string".match(/s/)` does all of these, plus also takes in the index, the initial string, and much more.

Some more examples:

```javascript
"strings".match(/i/) //=> ["t", index: 3, input: "strings"]
"555-1212".match(/2/) //=> [ '2', index: 5, input: '555-1212' ]
```

If we want to search for words instead of just characters, just put that inside the slashes:

```javascript
"hello everyone".match(/hello/)
// [ 'hello', index: 0, input: 'hello everyone' ]

"hello everyone".match(/eve/)
// [ 'eve', index: 6, input: 'hello everyone' ]

"hello everyone".match(/hello everyone/)
// [ 'hello everyone', index: 0, input: 'hello everyone' ]

"hello everyone".match(/o e/)
// [ 'o e', index: 4, input: 'hello everyone' ]

// /eve/ aka:

var search = "eve", string = "hello everyone"
for (let i = 0; i < string.length - search.length + 1; i++) {
  console.log(string.slice(i, i+search.length))
  if (search === string.slice(i, i + search.length)) {
    console.log(search)
    break
  }
}
```

We use a for loop here because we need to strictly use the indexes and not the individual characters. Once again though you can see how easy it is to use regex to do all of this for you!

### Match any one of these characters

Matching one character is fine, but what if we wanted to find the first vowel in a string? We'd say "find the letter `a` or `e` or `i` etc.". If we enclose characters in `[hard brackets]` it will return whichever of those characters that's found first:

```javascript
"hey".match(/[aeiou]/)
// [ 'e', index: 1, input: 'hey' ]

"hey".match(/h[aeiou]y/)
// [ 'hey', index: 0, input: 'hey' ]

"rhythm".match(/[aeiou]/)
// null

"string".match(/[regex]/)
// [ 'r', index: 2, input: 'string' ]

"find".match(/[any of these characters in these brackets]/)
// [ 'i', index: 1, input: 'find' ]

// [aeiou] aka:

if (x === "a" || x === "e" || x === "i" || x === "o" || x === "u" )
  { console.log(x) }
```

A fun group of words that only change by one vowel are blander, blender, blinder, blonder, and blunder. We can put our knowledge of hard brackets to use:

```javascript
"The food tasted blander".match(/bl[aeiou]nder/)
// [ 'blander', index: 16, input: 'The food tasted blander' ]
"Put the food in the blender".match(/bl[aeiou]nder/)
// [ 'blender', index: 20, input: 'Put the food in the blender' ]
"His eyes were blinder".match(/bl[aeiou]nder/)
// [ 'blinder', index: 14, input: 'His eyes were blinder' ]
"Their hair was blonder".match(/bl[aeiou]nder/)
// [ 'blonder', index: 15, input: 'Their hair was blonder' ]
"I made a blunder".match(/bl[aeiou]nder/)
// [ 'blunder', index: 9, input: 'I made a blunder' ]
```

You can also match any character by searching for `.` (it only ignores line breaks)

```javascript
"hey".match(/./)
// [ 'h', index: 0, input: 'hey' ]

"string".match(/./)
// [ 's', index: 0, input: 'string' ]

"string".match(/str.ng/)
// [ 'string', index: 0, input: 'string' ]

"strong".match(/str.ng/)
// [ 'strong', index: 0, input: 'strong' ]

"str@ng".match(/str.ng/)
// [ 'str@ng', index: 0, input: 'str@ng' ]

"\nthese\nare\nnew\nlines\n".match(/./)
// [ 't', index: 1, input: '\nthese\nare\nnew\nlines\n' ]

// aka

console.log(x.slice(0,1) !== "\n" ? x[0] : x[2] ) // repeating if 2-3 is \n, etc. etc. etc.
```

### Match any one of these words or groups of characters

Matching between words works a bit different than matching letters. We'll need to use the `or` operator `|`. Let's say we want to find if a string contains the words hello, hey, or hi:

```javascript
"RBG has green in it".match(/(red|green|blue)/)
// [ 'green', 'green', index: 0, input: 'RBG has green in it' ]

"hello everyone".match(/hello|hey|hi/)
// [ 'hello', index: 0, input: 'hello everyone' ]

"hey everyone".match(/hello|hey|hi/)
// [ 'hey', index: 0, input: 'hey everyone' ]

"hi everyone".match(/hello|hey|hi/)
// [ 'hi', index: 0, input: 'hi everyone' ]

"sup everyone".match(/hello|hey|hi/)
// null

"heyo everyone".match(/hello|hey|hi/)
// [ 'hey', index: 0, input: 'heyo everyone' ]

// aka

var search = ["hello", "hey", "hi"], string = "hello everyone"
for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
  search.forEach(word => {
    if (word === string.slice(i, i + word.length)) {
      console.log(word)      
    }
  })
}
```

Just like with regular work searching, it also matches the partial words like "heyo" including "hey".


### Match a group of characters part 2

We can take searching for individual characters or groups of characters one step further. Let's try some of the above examples but also encase them in parentheses:

```javascript
"strings".match(/(s)/)
// [ 's', 's', index: 0, input: 'strings' ]

"hello everyone".match(/(hello)/)
// [ 'hello', 'hello', index: 0, input: 'hello everyone' ]

"hey".match(/([aeiou])/)
// [ 'e', 'e', index: 1, input: 'hey' ]

"hey".match(/(.)/)
// [ 'h', 'h', index: 0, input: 'hey' ]

"strong".match(/(str.ng)/)
// [ 'strong', 'strong', index: 0, input: 'strong' ]

if (x === "s")
  { console.log(x, x) }
```

As you can see, there's a new element added into our result array. The second 's', 'hello', etc. returned is the word that was found in the parentheses. We can do this for multiple parentheses in a single regex script:

```javascript
"hello world".match(/(hello) (world)/)
// [ 'hello world', 'hello', 'world', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

// aka, just including the search, not the for/each for ease of reading

var a = ["hello", "world"]
if (x === a[0] + " " + a[1])
  { console.log([x, a[0], a[1]]) }

"string".match(/(s)(t)(ring)/)
// [ 'string', 's', 't', 'ring', index: 0, input: 'string' ]

var a = ["s", "t", "ring"]
if (x === a[0] + a[1] + a[2])
  { console.log([x, a[0], a[1], a[2]]) }
```

This way anything found in the resulting array after the first element (which is what's matched) will be what you find in the parenthesis(es). This becomes a highly important thing to know as you can call on the specific search term after you're done:

```javascript
"hello world".match(/(hello) (world)/)[0] //=> "hello world"
"hello world".match(/(hello) (world)/)[1] //=> "hello"
"hello world".match(/(hello) (world)/)[2] //=> "world"
```

as well as even more things you can do that I'll get into shortly.

### Match a range

What if we want to match a lowercase letter? An uppercase letter? A range of numbers or letters? Regex makes that easy as well. We can use the `[hard brackets]` which again will return whichever of those characters that's found first:

```javascript
"Hey123".match(/[a-z]/)
// [ 'e', index: 1, input: 'Hey123' ]

"Hey123".match(/[A-Z]/)
// [ 'H', index: 0, input: 'Hey123' ]

"Hey123".match(/[0-9]/)
// [ '1', index: 3, input: 'Hey123' ]

// any letter of any case, or any alphanumeric character

"123Hey".match(/[a-zA-Z]/)
// 'H', index: 3, input: '123Hey' ]

"@#^$& Hey 123".match(/[a-zA-Z0-9]/)
// [ 'H', index: 5, input: '@#^$&Hey123' ]

// any range works

"Hey123".match(/[m-z]/)
// [ 'y', index: 2, input: 'Hey123' ]

"Hey123".match(/[2-5]/)
// [ '2', index: 4, input: 'Hey123' ]
```

You can also do multi-digit ranges, but I'll cover that later as it's more advanced.

### Negating

What if you want to find the first **non** vowel? It'd be pretty tedious to do `[bcdfghjk...]` for every single consonant. Thankfully if you're using [hard brackets], you can simply start with the carrot `^` and it'll say "anything except these characters":

```javascript
"Hello123".match(/[^H]/)
// [ 'e', index: 1, input: 'Hello123' ]

"Hello123".match(/[^aeiou]/)
// [ 'H', index: 0, input: 'Hello123' ]

"Hello123".match(/[^A-Z]/)
// [ 'e', index: 1, input: 'Hello123' ]

"Hello123".match(/[^a-zA-Z]/)
// [ '1', index: 5, input: 'Hello123' ]
```

### Character Groups

Lastly in the basics section, it's fairly annoying to always have to use a range if you want a digit, an alphanumeric character, etc. There's only three major letters you need to know: `w`, `d` and `s` which stand for word, digit and space (more specifically whitespace). You use those letters by putting a backslash in front of it:

* `\w` finds any word character aka `[a-zA-Z0-9]` along with underscores `_` and ASCII/unicode letters (depending on the language).
* `\d` finds any digit aka `[0-9]`
* `\s` finds any whitespace character like a space, newline, tab, etc.

```javascript
"@#^$& Hey 123".match(/\w/)
// [ 'H', index: 6, input: '@#^$& Hey 123' ]

"@#^$& Hey 123".match(/\d/)
// [ '1', index: 10, input: '@#^$& Hey 123' ]

"@#^$& Hey 123".match(/\s/)
// [ ' ', index: 5, input: '@#^$& Hey 123' ]
```

Negating these expressions is just as easy: just capitalize the letter! If you want to find the first non-word character use `\W`, the first non-digit `\D`, and the first non-whitespace character `\S`.

```javascript
"123 Hey".match(/\W/)
// [ ' ', index: 3, input: '123 Hey' ]

"123 Hey".match(/\D/)
// [ ' ', index: 3, input: '123 Hey' ]

"123Hey".match(/\D/)
// [ 'H', index: 3, input: '123Hey' ]

"123 Hey".match(/\S/)
// [ '1', index: 0, input: '123 Hey' ]
```

# Quantity
---

There are a few quantity-type modifiers we can use in combination with what we already know. First up: what if instead of individual letters or digits we wanted to get whole words or numbers? Simply add a plus sign `+` after whatever character or group you'd like to search for more of and it will keep searching until it either reaches the end of the string or something that doesn't match:

```javascript
// Word characters / words

"hello".match(/\w/)
// [ 'h', index: 0, input: 'hello' ]

"hello".match(/\w+/)
// [ 'hello', index: 0, input: 'hello' ]

"hello world".match(/\w+/)
// [ 'hello', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]
// the space is the first non-word character, so it stops

// Digits / numbers

"there are 100 centimeters in a meter".match(/\d/)
// [ '1', index: 10, input: 'there are 100 centimeters in a meter' ]

"there are 100 centimeters in a meter".match(/\d+/)
// [ '100', index: 10, input: 'there are 100 centimeters in a meter' ]

"there are 100 centimeters in a meter".match(/\D/)
// [ 't', index: 0, input: 'there are 100 centimeters in a meter' ]

"there are 100 centimeters in a meter".match(/\D+/)
// [ 'there are ', index: 0, input: 'there are 100 centimeters in a meter' ]
// spaces are non-digits, so it goes until it finds an actual digit

// Whitespace / non whitespace

"hello world".match(/\s/)
// [ ' ', index: 5, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/\S/)
// [ 'h', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/\S+/)
// [ 'hello', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

// aka for "hello world".match(/\w+/)

var result = "", string = "hello world"
string.split("").some(x => {
  if ( x.match(/\w/) )
    { result += x }
  return x.match(/\w/) === null
})

console.log(result)
```

We can even combine these or use the `+` modifier on specific letters or words:

```javascript
"hello world".match(/\w+\s\w+/)
// [ 'hello world', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/(\w+)(\s)(\w+)/)
// [ 'hello world', 'hello', ' ', 'world', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/.+/)
// [ 'hello world', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/l+/)
// [ 'll', index: 2, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/el+/)
// [ 'ell', index: 1, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/(l)+/)
// [ 'll', 'l', index: 2, input: 'hello world' ]

"banana".match(/(na)+/)
// [ 'nana', 'na', index: 2, input: 'banana' ]

// aka for /l+/

var result = "", string = "hello world"
string.split("").some(x => {
  if ( x.match(/l/) )
    { result += x }
  return x.match(/l/) === null && result.length > 0
})
console.log(result)
```

The plus sign is just one quantity-type modifier which says "find one or more". There's also the asterisk `*` modifier that says "find zero or more", which is a fancy way of saying "if you don't find this, then just move on":

```javascript
"hello world".match(/\d*/)
// [ '', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/(\d)*/)
// [ '', undefined, index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]
```

Even though it didn't find a digit, it didn't give us null, and if we encase it in parentheses it'll give us undefined back. This is useful for when we try to search for say, if a specific character follows the letter "w" in a string, but if it doesn't then we still want to know if the letter "w" is even in the string:

```javascript
// find if the letter(s) o appears right after
"hello world".match(/wo*/)
// [ 'wo', index: 6, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello woooorld".match(/wo*/)
// [ 'woooo', index: 6, input: 'hello woooorld' ]

// find any character(s) after the w
"hello world".match(/w.*/)
// [ 'world', index: 6, input: 'hello world' ]

// and the letter r, which isn't right after
"hello world".match(/wr*/)
// [ 'w', index: 6, input: 'hello world' ]
```

And finally one of the most useful thing is asking for a specific number of characters or groups, or a range. We use {curly brackets} for this, using one number `{n}` to ask for a specific number, add a comma if you want to do at least that number `{n,}`, and add another number for the range `{n,n2}`:

```javascript
// match one
"hello world".match(/l/)
// same as
"hello world".match(/l{1}/)
// [ 'l', index: 2, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/l{2}/)
// [ 'll', index: 2, input: 'hello world' ]

// match more than one
"hello world".match(/l+/)
// same as
"hello world".match(/l{1,}/)
// [ 'll', index: 2, input: 'hello world' ]

// match more than zero
"hello world".match(/wr*/)
// same as
"hello world".match(/wr{0,}/)
// [ 'w', index: 6, input: 'hello world' ]

// more than x
"http://www.github.com".match(/w{2,}/)
// [ 'www', index: 7, input: 'http://www.github.com' ]

"http://www.github.com".match(/\w{5,}/)
// [ 'github', index: 11, input: 'http://www.github.com' ]

"http://www.github.com".match(/\W{2,}/)
// [ '://', index: 4, input: 'http://www.github.com' ]

// range

"http://www.github.com".match(/w{3,5}/)
// [ 'www', index: 7, input: 'http://www.github.com' ]

"http://www.github.com".match(/w{2,5}/)
// [ 'www', index: 7, input: 'http://www.github.com' ]

"http://www.github.com".match(/\w{5,7}/)
// [ 'github', index: 11, input: 'http://www.github.com' ]

// aka for "hello world".match(/l{2}/)

var count = 0

"hello world".split("").some(letter => {
  letter == "l" ? count++ : count = 0
  return count == 2
}) == true ? "ll" : false
//=> "ll"
```

In summary for quantity:

```javascript
// 1 or more
"hellooooooo".match(/o+/)
// [ 'ooooooo', index: 4, input: 'hellooooooo' ]

// 0 or more
"hellooooooo".match(/[a-z]*/)
// [ 'hellooooooo', index: 0, input: 'hellooooooo' ]

// specific numbers
"hello123".match(/[a-z]{3}/)
// [ 'hel', index: 0, input: 'hello123' ]

"hello123".match(/[a-z]{5}[0-9]{3}/)
// [ 'hello123', index: 0, input: 'hello123' ]

// specific numbers or more
"hello123".match(/[a-z]{3,}/)
// [ 'hello', index: 0, input: 'hello123' ]

// specific range of numbers
"hello123".match(/[a-z]{3,4}/)
// [ 'hell', index: 0, input: 'hello123' ]
"hello123".match(/[a-z]{0,7}/)
// [ 'hello', index: 0, input: 'hello123' ]
```

# Quiz Part 1
### Putting the basics into practice

If it wasn't already obvious, all of these methods are very useful for performing specific searches. Let's go through some vowel examples to really hammer down what you've learned so far.

Try answering these questions first before looking at the answers! I'll give the formats of what you may have to search by, then if you need hints I'll list the steps you'd need to do, then finally the answer.

---

### Short questions:

Easy:

Split up the word "string" by a vowel.
"Split up each word in this sentence by a vowel"

Medium:

How would you test if the word "queue" had four vowels in a row?
"Find the first vowel in this sentence followed by the letters j, k, l, or m"
Find the first two letters in the word "education" that don't contain the letters a through m"
"Find the first letter in this sentence that appears after two consecutive vowels"

Hard:

"Find the first word in this sentence that has a 'c' in it"
"Find the first word in this sentence that has a vowel followed by the letters j, k, l, or m"

### Short answers:

Easy:

**Split up the word "string" by a vowel.**

```javascript
"string".split(/[aeiou]/) //=> [ "str", "ng" ]

// aka

var string = "string"
["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"].forEach(x => {
	string = string.split(x).join(" ")
})
string.split(" ") //=> [ "str", "ng" ]
```

**"Split up each word in this sentence by a vowel"**

```javascript
var sentence = "Split up each word in this sentence by a vowel"
sentence.split(" ").map(l => l.split(/[aeiou]/))
// [ [ 'Spl', 't' ], [ '', 'p' ], [ '', '', 'ch' ], [ 'w', 'rd' ], [ '', 'n' ], [ 'th', 's' ], [ 's', 'nt', 'nc', '' ], [ 'by' ], [ '', '' ], [ 'v', 'w', 'l' ] ]
```

Same as before, except we'll do it for each letter. There's an easier way we'll do this later on.

#### Medium:

**How would you test if the word "queue" had four vowels in a row?**

```javascript
"queue".match(/[aeiou]{4}/)
// [ 'ueue', index: 1, input: 'queue' ]

!!("queue".match(/[aeiou]{4}/))
// or the easier
> /[aeiou]{4}/.test("queue")
// true

// aka

var count = 0, number = 4, letters = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], string = "queue"

string.split("").some(letter => {
  letters.includes(letter) ? count++ : count = 0
  return count == number
})
count //=> true
```

**"Find the first vowel in this sentence followed by the letters j, k, l, or m"**

```javascript
var sentence = "Find the first vowel in this sentence followed by the letters j, k, l, or m"
sentence.match(/([aeiou])[j-m]/)
// [ 'el', 'e', index: 53, input: 'Find the first letter in this sentence that has a vowel followed by the letters j, k, l, or m' ]
sentence.match(/([aeiou])[j-m]/)[1]
// 'e'
```

**Find the first two letters in the word "education" that don't contain the letters a through m"**

```javascript
"education".match(/[^a-m]{2}/)
// [ 'on', index: 7, input: 'education' ]
"education".match(/[^a-m]{2}/)[0]
// 'on'
```

**"Find the first letter in this sentence that appears after two consecutive vowels"**

```javascript
var sentence = "Find the first letter in this sentence that appears after two consecutive vowels"
sentence.match(/[aeiou]{2}(\w)/)
// [ 'ear', 'r', index: 47, input: 'Find the first letter in this sentence that appears after two consecutive vowels' ]
sentence.match(/[aeiou]{2}(\w)/)[1]
// 'r'
```

We first search for two consecutive letters using `[aeiou]{2}`, then the parentheses `()` to capture a word character `\w` that appears after it. The letters 'ear' are at index 47 in the word "appears".

Hard:

**Find the first sequence of at least 6 characters that are either non-vowels or the sequence of letters 'er', followed by either non-uppercase characters, uppercase letters between C and F, or lowercase vowels**

```javascript
var characters = "ThisLONGsequenceOfMANY(aka72(QuiteAbit))Characters!?!?(SeriouslyWhereIsTheBreak?)"
characters.match(/(([^aeiouAEIOU]|er)([^A-Z]|[C-F]|[aeiou])){6,}/)
// [ 'bit))Characters!?!?', '!?', '!', '?', index: 35, input: 'ThisLONGsequenceOfMANY(aka72(QuiteAbit))Characters!?!?(SeriouslyWhereIsTheBreak?)' ]
characters.match(/(([^aeiouAEIOU]|er)([^A-Z]|[C-F]|[aeiou])){6,}/)[0]
// 'bit))Characters!?!?'
```

This is pretty much a combination of the many things we learned all at once.

The first clause `([^aeiouAEIOU]|er)` - non-vowels (not the same as consonants since it will also include non-word characters) are `[^aeiouAEIOU]` which says not `^` any of these letters, then the sequence `er`, and both of these are wrapped in parentheses and separated by the 'or' `|` pipe to choose either one of these.

The second clause `([^A-Z]|[C-F]|[aeiou])` - non-uppercase characters (not the same as lowercase since it will also include non-letters) are `[^A-Z]` which says not `^` in the `A-Z` range, then the range `[C-F]`, and finally lowercase vowels `[aeiou]`, with all of these wrapped in parentheses and separated by the 'or' `|` pipe to choose any one of them.

Finally both of these clauses are wrapped in additional parentheses with at least 6 `{6,}` on the end so it applies to both clauses as a whole.

**"Find the first word in this sentence that has a 'c' in it"**

```javascript
"Find the first word in this sentence that has a 'c' in it".match(/\w*c\w*/)
// [ ' sentence ', 'sentence', index: 27, input: 'Find the first word in this sentence that has a \'c\' in it' ]
"Find the first word in this sentence that has a 'c' in it".match(/\w*c\w*/)[0]
// 'sentence'
```

We have our "c" in the exact middle of our script. On both sides we have `\w*` which says "look for at least 0 word characters" which means we can either start with a 'c' (0 word characters before), end with a 'c' (same but after), or be somewhere in the middle (at least one word character on both sides).


"Find a word in this sentence that has a vowel followed by the letters j, k, l, or m"

```javascript
var sentence = "Find a word in this sentence that has a vowel followed by the  letters p, q, r, s, or t"
sentence.match(/\w*[aeiou][p-t]\w*/)
```

Same as the above question, but using vowels and a range.

### Long questions:

These are the multi-part questions and will require a bit more thinking.

**1) Find the area code of a person's phone number**

Possible formats:

**Easy**
* 800-555-1212
* (800)-555-1212
* 8005551212
**Medium**
add country code:
* 1-800-555-1212
* 1-(800)-555-1212
* 18005551212
**Hard**
* make all dash examples work with the same script
**Extreme**
* note: you won't be able to do this unless you know about a few advanced techniques, so don't try this yet
* make all examples work with the same script
* I'll leave this one to you!

Step by step:

**Easy**
* find the first group of numbers (not just digits)
* or the better, limit to 3 digits
**Medium**
* search for non-digits first before you find three digits
* also search for a single digit first (country code)
* if having trouble, remember the operator to help search for at least *x* digits
**Hard**
* the main difference now is if there's a country code or not, how can we test that?
**Extreme**
* use lookaheads, anchors, and conditionals (the `?` is very important)

Easy answer:

```javascript
// partial answer (only works for first two)

"800-555-1212".match(/\d+/)
// [ '800', index: 0, input: '800-555-1212' ]
"(800)-555-1212".match(/\d+/)
// [ '800', index: 1, input: '(800)-555-1212' ]

"800-555-1212".match(/\d+/)[0]
"(800)-555-1212".match(/\d+/)[0]
// '800'

// or the better which works for all three examples

"800-555-1212".match(/\d{3}/)
// [ '800', index: 0, input: '800-555-1212' ]
"(800)-555-1212".match(/\d{3}/)
// [ '800', index: 1, input: '(800)-555-1212' ]
"8005551212".match(/\d{3}/)
// [ '800', index: 1, input: '8005551212' ]

"800-555-1212".match(/\d{3}/)[0]
"(800)-555-1212".match(/\d{3}/)[0]
"8005551212".match(/\d{3}/)[0]
// '800'
```

For the first partial answer, because there are parentheses `()` and/or a dash `-` we can simply search until you run out of numbers using `\d+`, however this doesn't work if it's just a string of 10 numbers.

In our full answer we fix this by finding the first three numbers using `\d{3}`.

Medium answer:

```javascript
// partial answer (only works for first two)

"1-800-555-1212".match(/\D+(\d{3})/)
// [ '-800', '800', index: 0, input: '1-800-555-1212' ]
"1-(800)-555-1212".match(/\D+(\d{3})/)
// [ '-(800', '800', index: 0, input: '1-(800)-555-1212' ]

"1-800-555-1212".match(/\D+(\d{3})/)[1]
"1-(800)-555-1212".match(/\D+(\d{3})/)[1]
// '800'

// or the better which works for all three examples


"1-800-555-1212".match(/\d\D*(\d{3})/)
// [ '1-800', '800', index: 0, input: '1-800-555-1212' ]
"1-(800)-555-1212".match(/\d\D*(\d{3})/)
// [ '1-(800', '800', index: 0, input: '1-(800)-555-1212' ]
"18005551212".match(/\d\D*(\d{3})/)
// [ '1800', '800', index: 0, input: '18005551212' ]

"1-800-555-1212".match(/\d\D*(\d{3})/)[1]
"1-(800)-555-1212".match(/\d\D*(\d{3})/)[1]
"18005551212".match(/\d\D*(\d{3})/)[1]
// '800'
```

For the first partial answer, just like before since there are parentheses `()` and/or a dash `-` we can simply search for at least one non-digit using `\D+` and then the first three numbers using `\d{3}`. However this doesn't work if there aren't any symbols, and just changing the `\D+` to `\D*` to make it "at least 0" doesn't work either as it will just start at the first digit "1".

In our full answer we fix this by not only changing to `\D*`, but first searching for that first number using `\d`. This way we'll always include the first 1 in our answer with `\d`, then search for non digits if they exist using `\D*`, and then the prior `\d{3}` as usual.

Hard answer:

```javascript
"800-555-1212".match(/\d{0,1}\D*(\d{3})/)
// [ '800', '800', index: 0, input: '800-555-1212' ]
"(800)-555-1212".match(/\d{0,1}\D*(\d{3})/)
// [ '(800', '800', index: 0, input: '(800)-555-1212' ]
"1-800-555-1212".match(/\d{0,1}\D*(\d{3})/)
// [ '1-800', '800', index: 0, input: '1-800-555-1212' ]
"1-(800)-555-1212".match(/\d{0,1}\D*(\d{3})/)
// [ '1-(800', '800', index: 0, input: '1-(800)-555-1212' ]

"800-555-1212".match(/\d{0,1}\D*(\d{3})/)[1]
"(800)-555-1212".match(/\d{0,1}\D*(\d{3})/)[1]
"1-800-555-1212".match(/\d{0,1}\D*(\d{3})/)[1]
"1-(800)-555-1212".match(/\d{0,1}\D*(\d{3})/)[1]
// '800'
```

Instead of the prior answer which was simply `\d`, we can force our script to only look for if there's up to one number by changing that to `\d{0,1}`. That way if there's a country code it will then look for the non-digits, however if there's no country code it will ignore any amount of digits over 1 since it's out of the `{0,1}` range. After that it will look for the non-digits as normal, then our area code.

**2) Find the username of a github user from the URL**

Possible formats:

**Easy**
* github.com/mikemerin
* www.github.com/mikemerin
* http://github.com/mikemerin
* http://www.github.com/mikemerin
**Medium**
* http://github.com/mikemerin/WeatherCraft
**Hard**
* http://github.com/mikemerin/WeatherCraft/tree/master/src
* make it work for all examples with the same script

Step by step:

**Easy**
* search for the .com/
* search for what's after that
* output that second search
**Medium**
* search up until you hit another backslash
* output after the .com/ and before the second backslash
**Hard**
* deal with multiple backslashes, making sure it matches the next one
* make your answer work for all the prior examples as well

Easy answer:

```javascript
// search for the .com/
"http://www.github.com/mikemerin".match(/(.com\/)/)
// [ '.com/', '.com/', index: 17, input: 'http://www.github.com/mikemerin' ]

// search for what's after that
"http://www.github.com/mikemerin".match(/(.com\/)(.+)/)
// [ '.com/mikemerin', '.com/', 'mikemerin', index: 17, input: 'http://www.github.com/mikemerin' ]

// output that second search
"http://www.github.com/mikemerin".match(/(.com\/)(.+)/)[2]
// 'mikemerin'
```

The elements returned are in order: search result, 1st parenthesis value, 2nd parenthesis value, so return the 2nd and that's your answer.

Medium answer:

```javascript
// search up until you hit another backslash
"http://github.com/mikemerin/WeatherCraft".match(/(.com\/)(.+)(\/)/)
// [ '.com/mikemerin/', '.com/', 'mikemerin', '/', index: 13, input: 'http://github.com/mikemerin/WeatherCraft' ]
"http://github.com/mikemerin/WeatherCraft".match(/(.com\/)(.+)(\/)/)[2]
// 'mikemerin'
```

If there's more to the URL like a repo, or settings, etc., you can add an additional search query like another backslash `/` and it'll separate itself from the second result as a third result.

Hard answer:

```javascript
// issue to fix for - not working with basic URLs without post-username characters:
"http://github.com/mikemerin".match(/(.com\/)(.+)(\/)/)
// null

// search up until you hit another backslash,
// BUT: search for all characters that AREN'T a backslash
"http://github.com/mikemerin/WeatherCraft".match(/(.com\/)([^\/]*)/)
// [ '.com/mikemerin', '.com/', 'mikemerin', index: 13, input: 'http://github.com/mikemerin/WeatherCraft' ]

// also fixed the prior issue
"http://github.com/mikemerin".match(/(.com\/)([^\/]*)/)
// [ '.com/mikemerin', '.com/', 'mikemerin', index: 13, input: 'http://github.com/mikemerin' ]

// also deals with multiple backslashes, making sure it matches the next one
"http://github.com/mikemerin/WeatherCraft/tree/master/src".match(/(.com\/)([^\/]*)/)
// [ '.com/mikemerin', '.com/', 'mikemerin', index: 13, input: 'http://github.com/mikemerin/WeatherCraft/tree/master/src' ]

// output that second search
"http://github.com/mikemerin/WeatherCraft/tree/master/src".match(/(.com\/)([^\/]*)/)[2]
// 'mikemerin'
```

The magic here is our `([^\/]*)`. Breaking it down: everything's surrounded by `(parentheses)` which outputs what's inside. We then have `[hard brackets]` which allows us to search for a specific character or characters. Inside the hard brackets we start with a carrot `^` which says "search for anything that's NOT in these hard brackets". The `\/` is our backslash search. Together the `[^\/]` says "search for all characters that aren't a backslash". Finally the asterisk `*` after this says "find as many of these characters as possible but if you don't find any that's fine, still output all the non-backslash characters."

That's the end of part 1, in [part 2](https://mikemerin.github.io/RegExp-2/) we'll cover even more techniques and advanced things you can do with Regex.

Code on.

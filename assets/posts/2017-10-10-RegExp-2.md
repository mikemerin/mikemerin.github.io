summary: How to use modifiers, lookbacks/aheads, and more
---
With the basics out of the way it's time to head into some more modifiers, complex syntax, and combinations of regular expressions that you can use.

In the [part 1](http://mikemerin.github.io/regexp-1) of this regex tutorial we covered a lot of basics and I strongly suggest going through it before reading this post. If you're experienced with regex then you can simply go through the quiz at the end of the post to make sure you know the techniques used so far.

Again, this isn't merely a regex cheat sheet; there are plenty of those on the internet already and it's not always the best way to learn something from scratch. This is a step-by-step breakdown of what the many parts of regex can do, and includes scripts that show what the regex does the hood and how it simplifies the process entirely. This way if you have absolutely no experience with regex you can learn it through examples and explanations, and even if you know regex it'll help solidify that knowledge.

What inspired this post was a [question on Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/regex-password-validation) about using regular expressions to validate a strong password. I'll go piece by piece to solve that and in doing so learn many different techniques!

So now that we have a good amount of knowledge under our belt let's add some more.

# Modifiers Part 2

### Start / end of line

This can also be considered basics, however I'm going to group them with other parts of regex that do similar things.

We can attach any regex script to the start of a line by using a carrot `^` at the start of our script, or attach any regex script to the end of a line by using the dollar sign `$` at the end of our script.

```javascript
// find the first character
"hello world".match(/^./)
// [ 'h', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

//find the last character
"hello world".match(/.$/)
// [ 'd', index: 10, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/^\w+/)
// [ 'hello', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]
"hello world".match(/\w+$/)
// [ 'world', index: 6, input: 'hello world' ]

// aka

var string = "hello world"

string.match(/^./) == string[0]
string.match(/.$/) == string[string.length-1]
string.match(/^\w+/) == string.split(" ")[0]
string.match(/\w+$/) == string.split(" ")[string.split(" ").length - 1]
```

A quick note on the carrot `^` - this carrot is different than the carrot we use for negation. The carrot outside of `[hard brackets]` says "start of the line", while inside the brackets say "negate what's in these brackets".

We use the start/end modifiers to make sure we only test things at those specific locations. We can also combine these to search the entire string from start to finish:


```javascript
"hello world".match(/^.+$/)
// [ 'hello world', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]
```

All of this is great for validation, say making sure the above "hello world" was just that and nothing more:

```javascript
"hello world".match(/hello world/)
// [ 'hello world', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/^hello world$/)
// [ 'hello world', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world and other lifeforms".match(/hello world/)
// [ 'hello world', index: 0, input: 'hello world and other lifeforms' ]

"hello world and other lifeforms".match(/^hello world$/)
// null

// aka

"hello world and other lifeforms" === "hello world and other lifeforms" //=> true
"hello world and other lifeforms" === "hello world" //=> false
```

### Boundaries

Sometimes we don't simply want the start or end of a line, aka a line boundary, but may want to look for word boundaries instead. Just like with `^` or `$` for lines, we can use `\b` to search for a word boundary. This is more fluid as it searches for ANY word boundary whether it's the start or end of the word.

```javascript
"hello world".match(/\b/)
// [ '', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/\b./)
// [ 'h', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/.\b/)
// [ 'o', index: 4, input: 'hello world' ]

// aka

var string = "hello world"

string.match(/\b./) == string.split(" ")[0][0]
string.match(/.\b/) == string.split(" ")[0][string.split(" ")[0].length-1]
```

In the first example `\b`, the first thing it finds is the empty boundary '' which is the start of the word "hello". In the second example, we search for a word boundary (which is the empty '' in front of "hello"), then any character which in this case is the "h" in hello. In the third example we search for the first character before a word boundary which in this case is the "o" at the end of hello. Using word boundaries means we effectively cut the entire string above into only the first word that appears.

```javascript
"hello world".match(/\b\w+/)
// [ 'hello', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]
"hello world".match(/\w+\b/)
// [ 'hello', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

// aka

var string = "hello world"

string.match(/\b\w+/) == string.split(" ")[0]
string.match(/\w+\b/) == string.split(" ")[0]
```

Even though we have our `\b` before and after our word `\w+` it returns the same "hello" because that's where the first word boundary lies. Of course we can take this further and test for specific characters or words that appear around word boundaries:

```javascript
"hello world".match(/\bw/)
// [ 'w', index: 6, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/\bworld\b/)
// [ 'world', index: 6, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/\bhello world\b/)
// [ 'hello world', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]
```

And we can combine this with multiples for validation, or use start/end modifiers with it:

```javascript
// the first word with four characters
"There are quite a few words in this sentence".match(/\b\w{4}\b/)
// [ 'this', index: 31, input: 'There are quite a few words in this sentence' ]

// a number has digits then capital letters
"123NUMBERnumber".match(/^\d+[A-Z]+/)
// [ '123NUMBER', index: 0, input: '123NUMBERnumber' ]

"5 is between 4 and 7".match(/^[4-7]/)
// [ '5', index: 0, input: '5 is between 4 and 7' ]

// a telephone number
"(123)-456-7890".match(/^\([0-9]{3}\)\-[0-9]{3}\-[0-9]{4}/)
// [ '(123) 456-7890', index: 0, input: '(123) 456-7890' ]

// just having fun now
"abc.def.ghi.jkl".match(/^(.{3}\.){3}.{3}$/)
// [ 'abc.def.ghi.jkl', 'ghi.', index: 0, input: 'abc.def.ghi.jkl' ]
```

In part 1 I went through number ranges, well now that we have start/end modifiers at our disposal we can do advanced ranges. Here's an example of 1-12 for a month:

```javascript
"12".match(/^([1-9]|1[0-2])$/)
// [ '12', '12', index: 0, input: '12' ]

"1".match(/^([1-9]|1[0-2])$/)
// [ '1', '1', index: 0, input: '1' ]
```

The script does the first number, and if it's between 1 and 9 it'll match, or if instead it finds two digits and the first is a 1, it will give preference over the double digit range since it willbe more truthy. We can also do this for the entire date:

```javascript
"10-12-17".match(/^([1-9]|1[0-2])-([1-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-9]|3[0-1])-(\d{2})$/)
// [ '10-12-17', '10', '12', '17', index: 0, input: '10-12-17' ]
```

### Outside script modifiers

I'm going to cover only two most common modifiers here: "i" and "g". The first one "i" just says "ignore the case of what I'm searching by"

```javascript
"hello world".match(/O/)
// null

"hello world".match(/O/i)
// [ 'o', index: 4, input: 'hello world' ]

"HELLO WORLD".match(/o/i)
// [ 'O', index: 4, input: 'HELLO WORLD' ]

"Hello Mr. Smith, how are you?".match(/h/i)
// [ 'H', index: 0, input: 'Hello Mr. Smith, how are you?' ]

"Hello Mr. Smith, how are you?".match(/h\w*/i)
// [ 'Hello', index: 0, input: 'Hello Mr. Smith, how are you?' ]

// aka

var search = "o", string = "HELLO EVERYONE"
string.split("").some(x => {
  return x.toLowerCase() === search.toLowerCase()
})
```

There are many times we want to find **everything** that matches, not just the first thing. In Ruby you can simply use `scan` instead of match:

```ruby
"hello world".scan(/[aeiou]/)
# ["e", "o", "o"]
```

and it will do it for us. In JavaScript and other languages just use the "g" flag to do this:


```javascript
"hello world".match(/[aeiou]/g)
// [ 'e', 'o', 'o' ]

"Find all words in this sentence start with the letter s.".match(/\bs\w*/g)
// [ 'sentence', 'start', 's' ]

// aka for the vowels

"hello world".split("").filter(x => ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u" ].includes(x) )
// [ 'e', 'o', 'o' ]
```

And of course we can combine them together:

```javascript
"hElLo EvErYoNe".match(/[aeiou]/gi)
// [ 'E', 'o', 'E', 'E', 'o', 'e' ]
```

# Advanced Parentheses

### Backreferencing

You're used to using parentheses by now, well now it's time to do some more advanced techniques that I hinted at in the first post. You already know that putting things in parentheses lets you tap into them once the query is finished:

```javascript
"racecar".match(/(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)/)
// [ 'racecar', 'r', 'a', 'c', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'r', index: 0, input: 'racecar' ]

"racecar".match(/(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)/)[1]
// 'r'

"racecar".match(/(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)/)[2]
// 'a'

"racecar".match(/(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)/)[3]
// 'c'
```

The 1 is 'r', 2 is 'a', etc., but did you know that you can access these numbers **while you're in your script?** We can use `(\1)` to access the first parentheses, `(\2)` for the second, etc.

How can we use this to our advantage? If you haven't noticed already, "racecar" is a palindrome aka it's read the same forewards as it is backwards, so the 1st letter is the same as the last letter. We can see if the last letter is the same as `(\1)` by doing this:

```javascript
"racecar".match(/(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\1)/)
// [ 'racecar', 'r', 'a', 'c', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'r', index: 0, input: 'racecar' ]
```

Success! We can continue this for the other letters as well, seeing if the 2nd letter is the 2nd to last letter, etc.:

```javascript
"racecar".match(/(\w)(\w)(\w)(\w)(\3)(\2)(\1)/)
// [ 'racecar', 'r', 'a', 'c', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'r', index: 0, input: 'racecar' ]

// aka

var string = "racecar"
var one = string[0], two = string[1], three = string[2]
three === string[4] && two === string[5] && one === string[6]
```

We initially wanted to find a generic word character `\w` but once we found it we could then test the letter that was found. Here are a few more examples:

```javascript
// does the third letter repeat?
"letter".match(/.{2}(\w){2}/)
// [ 'lett', 't', index: 0, input: 'letter' ]

// note that the captured (\w) is a single 't' repeated twice, not 'tt'

// does the first digit appear again?
"86753091234567890".match(/(\d).*\1/)
// [ '867530912345678', '8', index: 0, input: '86753091234567890' ]
```

And a bunch more things we can do to take advantage of what we captured:

```javascript
"12341234".match(/(.)234\1/)
// [ '12341', '1', index: 0, input: '12341234' ]

"12341234".match(/(.)(.)(.)(.)\1\2\3\4/)
// [ '12341234', '1', '2', '3', '4', index: 0, input: '12341234' ]

"radar".match(/(.)(\w)d\2\1/)
// [ 'radar', 'r', 'a', index: 0, input: 'radar' ]

"hello world".match(/hell(\w) w\1/)
// [ 'hello wo', 'o', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

// can be used to test for consistency

"9/23/2017".match(/^\d{1,2}(\D)\d{1,2}\1\d{4}/)
// [ '9/23/2017', '/', index: 0, input: '9/23/2017' ]

// you can see the / was captured

"9-23-2017".match(/^\d{1,2}(\D)\d{1,2}\1\d{4}/)
// [ '9-23-2017', '-', index: 0, input: '9-23-2017' ]

"9-23/2017".match(/^\d{1,2}(\D)\d{1,2}\1\d{4}/)
// null

// can also limit what's used with an "or" statement, in this case either - or / but nothing else

"9-23-2017".match(/^\d{1,2}(\/|\-)\d{1,2}\1\d{4}/)
// [ '9-23-2017', '-', index: 0, input: '9-23-2017' ]

"9/23/2017".match(/^\d{1,2}(\/|\-)\d{1,2}\1\d{4}/)
// [ '9/23/2017', '/', index: 0, input: '9/23/2017' ]

"9 23 2017".match(/^\d{1,2}(\/|\-)\d{1,2}\1\d{4}/)
// null

// validating phone numbers like we did in the prior blog post, but easier!

"123-456-7890".match(/^\d{3}(\D?)\d{3}\1\d{4}/)
// [ '123-456-7890', '-', index: 0, input: '123-456-7890' ]

"1234567890".match(/^\d{3}(\D?)\d{3}\1\d{4}/)
// [ '1234567890', '', index: 0, input: '1234567890' ]

"123-4567890".match(/^\d{3}(\D?)\d{3}\1\d{4}/)
// null

"123456-7890".match(/^\d{3}(\D?)\d{3}\1\d{4}/)
// null
```

# Quantifiers Part 2

We already know about 5 different quantifiers:

more than 0 `*`
more than 1 `+`
exactly n `{n}`
at least n `{n,}`
ranges `{n1,n2}`

Seems like these can do quite a bit right? Well this is only a third of what we can do with quantifiers since we can combine them with two quantifiers:

the lazy `?` which means "do the least possible"
the double greedy `+` which means don't stop, do as much as possible

The lazy `?` modifies our search to basically stop as soon as the minimum requirement is reached. In ranges this means it'll stop when the lowest range is hit, and if nothing is found then it just continues on its way without erroring.

The greedy `+` works differently in different engines, for example in JavaScript it acts like a repeater, however in most other languages it acts like it's not going to stop your search until the very end. We're not going to cover the greedy modifier here as its posessiveness can get very messy and cause some errors, however here are some examples of what the lazy `?` can do:

```javascript
"hello world".match(/\w?/)
// [ 'h', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]
// it found a word character, then was too lazy to continue

"hello world".match(/\w*?/)
// [ '', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]
// it found the word character, and its initial boundary, then was too lazy to continue

"hello world".match(/\w+?/)
// [ 'h', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]
// it found at least one, then was too lazy to continue

"hello world".match(/\w??/)
// [ '', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]
// it found a word character, then was too lazy to continue, and too lazy to even reach the word

"hello world".match(/\w{2,}?/)
// [ 'he', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]
// it found at least 2 word characters, then was too lazy to continue

"hello world".match(/\w{2,5}?/)
// [ 'he', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]
// it found at least 2 word characters, then was too lazy to continue
```

This is useful for a few reasons as you can see, but there's another thing we can take advantage of: optional characters. Here's another example that will show what I mean:

```javascript
"hello world".match(/\d?/)
// [ '', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/(\d)?/)
// [ '', undefined, index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]
```

Even though there's no digit in our strings the script doesn't null out. We can use this to search for things, but if it doesn't happen to be in there then the script will continue searching for the next thing:


```javascript
"there is not an explanation here".match(/(\w+\s\w+) (not )(.+)/)
// or
"there is not an explanation here".match(/(\w+\s\w+) (not )?(.+)/)
//[ 'there is not an explanation here', 'there is', 'not ', 'an explanation here', index: 0, input: 'there is not an explanation here' ]

"there is an explanation here".match(/(\w+\s\w+) (not )(.+)/)
// null
"there is an explanation here".match(/(\w+\s\w+) (not )?(.+)/)
// [ 'there is an explanation here', 'there is', undefined, 'an explanation here', index: 0, input: 'there is an explanation here' ]

// aka

var words = "there is an explanation here".split(" ")
words[0] == "there is"
words[1] == "not " ? "not " : undefined
words[2] == "an explanation here"
```

Even though the word "not " doesn't appear in the second example the script continues on as normal allowing us to still get the output we need. Without that lazy `?` we'd simply get `null` returned.

# Alternate syntax for lookarounds and AND

### Lookarounds

I'm combining these two together since they're very similar syntax. A preface here: even though we just used a question mark `?` as a lazy modifier, if it's inside of parentheses it acts as a separate query. This is similar to the carrot `^` acting differently if it's inside [hard brackets] or not.

First off, what is a lookaround? It basically is a check to see if something in our string exists, and if it does then we can continue searching for what we wanted for in the first place. There are two ways to do this, looking ahead aka lookaheads, and looking behind aka lookbehinds. JavaScript doesn't support lookbehinds, so let's first start with a lookahead example:


```javascript
"hello world".match(/.+(?=world)/)
// [ 'hello ', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello world".match(/.+(?=everyone)/)
// null
```

We searched for at least 1 character with `.+`, and added in our query to see if "world" exists in the string using `(?=world)`. You'll notice that the answer returned was just the "hello " without "world", and even though the world is captured inside parentheses it didn't return it as an additional value. When we use parentheses and the `?=` we basically say "does this search term even exist?"

In the first example, "world" exists, so we'll return the prior query. However in the second example "world" doesn't exist, so even though we found more than one character, it doesn't satify all of our conditions and therefore will just return null. We can put our query before as well:

```javascript
"hello world".match(/(?=hello).+/)
// [ 'hello world', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

"goodbye world".match(/(?=hello).+/)
// null
```

and similar to before it tests to see if the word "hello" is in the string, this time however the query is in the first word so once that condition is satisfied the regular `.+` search starts right away, hence why the full 'hello world' is returned. Just like before, the second doesn't have our query so it will return null. Here are some more examples:

```javascript
"only if followed by".match(/followed (?=by)/)
// [ 'followed ', index: 8, input: 'only if followed by' ]
"test".match(/t(?=t)/)
// null
"testtttt".match(/t(?=t)/)
// [ 't', index: 3, input: 'testtttt' ]
"testtttt".match(/t(?=t)/g)
// [ 't', 't', 't', 't' ]
```

Of course there's a way to search if something is **not** included, aka a negative lookahead:

```javascript
"hello world".match(/(?!hello).+/)
// [ 'ello world', index: 1, input: 'hello world' ]
```

We simply replace the equals sign with an explanation mark, just like we would for normal syntax (=== vs !==). What this returns is a bit strange, but basically if we negate our lookahead then it will try to return something that doesn't match "hello". Some more examples:

```javascript
"if not followed by".match(/followed (?!buy)/)
// [ 'followed ', index: 7, input: 'if not followed by' ]
"test".match(/t(?!t)/)
// [ 't', index: 0, input: 'test' ]
"testtttt".match(/t(?!t)/)
// [ 't', index: 0, input: 'testtttt' ]
"testtttt".match(/t(?!t)/g)
// [ 't', 't' ] (t followed by e, then t at the end followed by "")
```

For lookbehinds I'll quickly switch over to Ruby. This works the same way except (as the name suggests) we'll be looking behind the expression rather than ahead of it:


```ruby
"hello world".match(/(?<=hello).+/)
# <MatchData " world">

"hello world".match(/(?<=everyone).+/)
# nil
```

Negative lookbehinds are even more strange. At its core we can use the lookarounds to return specific searches while making sure there's other specific things elsewhere in the string. Here's a few more examples:

```ruby
"only if preceded by".match(/(?<=preceded) by/)
#=> #<MatchData " by">
"test".match(/(?<=t)t/)
#=> nil
"testtttt".match(/(?<=t)t/)
#=> #<MatchData "t">
"testtttt".scan(/(?<=t)t/)
#=> ["t", "t", "t", "t"]


"only if not preceded by".match(/(?<!not) preceded/)
#=> nil
"only if not preceded by".match(/(?<!nope) preceded/)
#=> #<MatchData "preceded">
"test".match(/(?<!t)t/)
#=> #<MatchData "t">
"testtttt".match(/(?<!t)t/)
#=> #<MatchData "t">
"testtttt".scan(/(?<!t)t/)
#=> ["t", "t"]
```

### AND

Unfortunately unlike using an 'or' statement like `(this|or|that)` which is fairly straightforward and easy to use, AND is a bit different. But now that we've learned a bit about lookarounds, we can actually use them to our advantage! The `?=` syntax inside of parentheses says "lookahead for if this is in our string". Well thankfully we can put many of these back to back and it'll say "lookahead for this, and this" for the same location! We can put as many of these together as we want, and it will effectively be an AND statement.

Let's say we wanted to make sure there was a word that started with the letter "l" while also having two "t"s in it:

```javascript
"letter".match(/(?=\bl)(?=\w*t{2})\w+/)
// [ 'letter', index: 0, input: 'letter' ]
```

`\bl` means "word boundary, then the letter l" aka start of the word is l
`\w*t{2}` means "anywhere in the word there are two t's next to one another"
`\w+` is to search for the word if our two prior queries passed the test

We string the queries together with `(?=query)` and they're effectively our AND statement! Here's another that says "if the string has 'hello' and 'world' in it, then return the whole string"


```javascript
"hello world".match(/(?=.*hello)(?=.*world).+/)
// [ 'hello world', index: 0, input: 'hello world' ]

"hello everyone in the world".match(/(?=.*hello)(?=.*world).+/)
// [ 'hello everyone in the world', index: 0, input: 'hello everyone in the world' ]

"hey everyone in the world".match(/(?=.*hello)(?=.*world).+/)
// null
```

As long as all of our `(?=)` queries are true then we'll execute our search.

# Quiz Part 2
### Putting the advanced parts into practice

It's time to go through some more vowel examples to really hammer down everything you've learned so far.

Try answering these questions first before looking at the answers! I'll give the formats of what you may have to search by, then if you need hints I'll list the steps you'd need to do, then finally the answer.

---

### Short questions:

**Easy**
"Find all vowels in this sentence that appear before two of the same letter"
"tell me which words in this sentence start with the letter t"
**Medium**
"Find all vowels in this sentence that are followed by double letters (just return the vowels)"
**Hard**
"tell me which words in this sentence contain the first letter in this sentence"
"tell me which words in this sentence contain any of the letters in the first word of this sentence"
"tell me which words in this sentence start with the first letter in this sentence"


hints:

**Easy**
Think about how we'd test to make sure a certain character is searched for again? Also the global flag will help
Use boundaries to help search for words
**Medium**
How do you search for something but exclude it from returning?
**Hard**
Figure out the 2nd easy question first, then think about how you'd change that to instead capture the letter instead of using it outright.
If that doesn't help, then try to capture the t in `/\bt\w*/g`, but working for any type of sentence (also think \1)



### Short answers:

Easy answers:

```javascript
var sentence = "Find all vowels and the double letters that follow them in this sentence"
sentence.match(/[aeiou](\w)\1/g)
// [ 'all', 'ett', 'oll' ]
```

We want double letters, so we capture any word character `(\w)` then call it again with backreferencing `\1`

```javascript
var sentence = "tell me which words in this sentence start with the letter t"
sentence.match(/\bt\w*/g)
// [ 'tell', 'this', 'the', 't' ]
```

Since we're searching for the letter t, we can use the word boundary `\b` and then a `t` to say "starts with a t", followed by a `\w*` to say "any number of characters after this". We then end with the global `/g` flag to find every one that appears.

Medium answer:

```javascript
var sentence = "Find all vowels in this sentence that are followed by double letters (just return the vowels)"
sentence.match(/[aeiou](?=(\w)\1)/g)
// [ 'a', 'o', 'e' ]

// for reference of what they are:
sentence.match(/[aeiou](\w)\1/g)
// [ 'all', 'oll', 'ett' ]
```

We take the medium answer we found but instead wrap it all in a lookahead `(?=)` to make sure we search for it but don't actually return the value.

Hard answers:

"tell me which words in this sentence contain the first letter in this sentence"

```javascript
var sentence = "tell me which words in this sentence contain the first letter in this sentence"
sentence.match(/(\w)(\1)*/g)
```

### Long question:

This is a multi-part question and will require a bit more thinking.

**Password Strength - test for how strong passwords are by these merits**

At least six characters long
contains a lowercase letter
contains an uppercase letter
contains a number
Bonus - Valid passwords will only be alphanumeric characters (weaker but a challenge)
Super Bonus: do ALL of these in one search.

Weak <= 2 passed
Medium = 3 passed
Strong = 4 passed

```javascript
var s1 = "pass"
var s2 = "password"
var s3 = "PASSWORD"
var s4 = "Password"
var s5 = "Password123"
var s6 = "Password123!"
```

Step by step:

* At least six characters long
* * basic, no help needed
* contains a lowercase letter
* contains an uppercase letter
* contains a number
* * these three are very similar, remember back to how we searched for something within a single word
* * there's the alternative as well that used lookaheads
* Bonus - Valid passwords will only be alphanumeric characters (weaker but a challenge)
* * remember to escape
* Super Bonus: do ALL of these in one search.
* * remember to use our AND to our advantage `(?=query)`

Answers:

We're going to create an array to iterate over, testing out each merit:

```javascript
// at least six characters long
var s1 = "pass"
var s2 = "password"
var s3 = "PASSWORD"
var s4 = "Password"
var s5 = "Password123"
var s6 = "Password123!"

var passwords = [s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6]
```

At least six characters long:

```javascript
passwords.forEach(x => console.log(
  x.match(/.{6,}/)
))

// null
// [ 'password', index: 0, input: 'password' ]
// [ 'PASSWORD', index: 0, input: 'PASSWORD' ]
// [ 'Password', index: 0, input: 'Password' ]
// [ 'Password123', index: 0, input: 'Password123' ]
// [ 'Password123!', index: 0, input: 'Password123!' ]
```

The next three are almost identical, contains a lowercase letter, an uppercase letter, and a number:

```javascript
passwords.forEach(x => console.log(
  x.match(/.*[a-z]/)
))

// [ 'pass', index: 0, input: 'pass' ]
// [ 'password', index: 0, input: 'password' ]
// null
// [ 'Password', index: 0, input: 'Password' ]
// [ 'Password', index: 0, input: 'Password123' ]
// [ 'Password', index: 0, input: 'Password123!' ]

passwords.forEach(x => console.log(
  x.match(/.*[A-Z]/)
))

// null
// null
// [ 'PASSWORD', index: 0, input: 'PASSWORD' ]
// [ 'P', index: 0, input: 'Password' ]
// [ 'P', index: 0, input: 'Password123' ]
// [ 'P', index: 0, input: 'Password123!' ]

passwords.forEach(x => console.log(
  x.match(/.*[0-9]/)
))

// null
// null
// null
// null
// [ 'Password123', index: 0, input: 'Password123' ]
// [ 'Password123', index: 0, input: 'Password123!' ]
```

Valid passwords will only be alphanumeric characters:

```javascript
passwords.forEach(x => console.log(
  x.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$/)
))

// null
// [ 'password', index: 0, input: 'password' ]
// [ 'PASSWORD', index: 0, input: 'PASSWORD' ]
// [ 'Password', index: 0, input: 'Password' ]
// [ 'Password123', index: 0, input: 'Password123' ]
// null
```

Putting it all together:

```javascript
passwords.forEach(x => console.log(
  x.match(/(?=.{6,})(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9])(?=^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$)/)
))

// we can combine the `.{6,}` for character length with the actual alphanumeric character validation by replacing the `*` which says "at least one" with that "at least 6":

passwords.forEach(x => console.log(
  x.match(/(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9])(?=^[a-zA-Z0-9]{6,}$)/)
))

// and we can make the query even shorter by removing that last "?=" statement:

passwords.forEach(x => console.log(
  x.match(/(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9])^[a-zA-Z0-9]{6,}$/)
))

// and for better practice we can move the start `^` to the actual start of the regex:

passwords.forEach(x => console.log(
  x.match(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9])[a-zA-Z0-9]{6,}$/)
))

// and all will output the same thing:

// null
// null
// null
// null
// [ '', index: 0, input: 'Password123' ]
// null
```

Now if we want to enforce an even stronger password by removing the limit on alphanumeric characters we can add a "contains a special character" in the same way we contain a lowercase/uppercase/number:

```javascript
passwords.forEach(x => console.log(
  x.match(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[`~!@#\$%\^&\*\(\)\-_=+]).{6,}$/)
))

// null
// null
// null
// null
// null
// [ 'Password123!', index: 0, input: 'Password123!' ]
```

Notice how we have to escape a few of the special characters like `$*()-` since otherwise they'd be used as regex syntax rather than as the characters themselves.

That's it for now. There are some more advanced regex techniques not covered here like quirks, recursion, Ruby's class intersection / subtraction / union, and much more. I encourage you to look them up on your own and try them out if you're interested!

Code on.
